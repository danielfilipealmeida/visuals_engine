# Visuals Engine

**Visuals Engine** is a library designed for creating real-time, reactive multimedia applications. Built with [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), it provides a foundation for developers to craft dynamic visual experiences. While the repository includes example applications—such as a simple VJing tool—the primary focus is on the underlying engine tailored for new media and reactive multimedia projects.
