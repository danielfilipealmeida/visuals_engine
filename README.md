# Visuals Engine

**Visuals Engine** is a library designed for creating real-time, reactive multimedia applications. Built with [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), it provides a foundation for developers to craft dynamic visual experiences. While the repository includes example applicationsâ€”such as a simple VJing toolâ€”the primary focus is on the underlying engine tailored for new media and reactive multimedia projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) (version 0.11.0 or later)



## Installation & Compilation Guide

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielfilipealmeida/visuals_engine.git
cd visuals_engine
```

---

### 2. **Set Up Dependencies**

* Ensure [**openFrameworks**](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) is installed and properly configured on your system.
* Install the required addons (include them in your `addons.make` as needed):

  * `ofxGui`
  * `ofxMidi`
  * `ofxFft`

---

### 3. **Project Structure**

```
visuals_engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ engine/               # Core rendering and processing logic (built as a static library)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/              # Output: libEngine.a
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VisualsEngine.xcodeproj  # macOS-only
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hello_world/      # Individual example using the engine
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ config.make
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ hello_world.xcodeproj  # macOS-only
```

---

### 4. **Building the Project**

#### ðŸ–¥ macOS (Xcode)

* Open the `VisualsEngine.xcodeproj` file at the **project root** to build the `engine` and shared code.
* For each example, open the `.xcodeproj` file inside its folder, e.g.:

```bash
open ./examples/hello_world/hello_world.xcodeproj
```

* Build and run the example from Xcode.

####  Linux (Makefiles)

Linux uses the openFrameworks makefile infrastructure to build both the engine and the examples.

#####  Step 1: Build the Engine (static library)

```bash
cd engine
make
```

This will create `lib/libEngine.a`.

##### ðŸŽ® Step 2: Build the Example

```bash
cd ../examples/hello_world
make
```

##### ðŸ“¦ Step 3: Copy Runtime Resources

```bash
make post
```

> This step ensures required assets like shaders are copied into `bin/data/`.

---

### 5.  Running the Example

After building, youâ€™ll find the compiled binary at:

```bash
examples/hello_world/bin/hello_world
```

Make sure to run it from the same folder (or that it has access to the `bin/data/` files you copied during `make post`).

Let me know if you'd like this turned into a `README.md`, or if you're ready to generate instructions for other examples automatically.


## Usage

After building the project, you can run the example VJing application or develop your own applications using the Visuals Engine library. Refer to the `examples` directory (to be added) for sample projects demonstrating various features.
